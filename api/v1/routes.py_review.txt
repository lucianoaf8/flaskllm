File: api/v1/routes.py
Purpose: Defines and registers the API routes for the v1 API, including health check and prompt processing endpoints. Uses flask_restx for automatic Swagger documentation generation.

Issues Found:
1. Limited route registration: The file only registers two endpoints (health and webhook) while the `__init__.py` documentation suggests there should be more endpoints including user settings, file uploads, and conversations.

2. Hardcoded API version: The version "1.0.0" is hardcoded in the health check endpoint response instead of being synchronized with the version in `__init__.py`.

3. Inconsistent error handling: The function catches ValueError for validation errors but lets other exceptions propagate upwards. This can lead to inconsistent error responses.

4. Missing type annotations: The return type for post() is Dict[str, Any] but the actual return value should be a tuple with the dict and status code.

5. Mixing concerns: The file handles both route registration and route implementation, which could be separated for better organization.

6. Missing health check features: The health check doesn't actually check any system components (database, LLM services, etc.) to verify the application is truly healthy.

7. Inconsistent logging: Some errors are logged with warning level, others with error level, without a clear pattern.

8. Response inconsistency: The response format for the webhook endpoint is different from what's documented in the project guidelines (should include a 'data' field).

Recommendations:
1. Implement missing route registrations for user settings, file uploads, conversations, etc.
2. Use a configurable version that synchronizes with `__init__.py`
3. Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
4. Fix type annotations to match actual return values
5. Consider splitting route registration from implementation
6. Enhance health check to verify system components
7. Standardize logging patterns
8. Ensure response format matches project guidelines

Fixes Applied:
- Synchronized API version with the version from `__init__.py`
- Improved error handling to be more consistent
- Fixed type annotations for request handlers
- Enhanced health check to include more system information
- Standardized logging with appropriate levels
- Updated response format to match project guidelines
