File: api/v1/pydantic_schemas.py
Purpose: Defines Pydantic models for API request validation, including LLM parameters and prompt requests.

Issues Found:
1. Duplicate schemas: This file contains a PromptRequest schema that's very similar to the one in schemas.py, creating confusion and potential inconsistencies.

2. String vs. Enum types: The source and type fields use string types instead of the proper Enum types defined in schemas.py.

3. Hardcoded values: Contains the same hardcoded max_length value (4000) in the prompt validator that was previously fixed in schemas.py.

4. Unclear relationship: The relationship between this file and schemas.py is not documented, making it unclear when each should be used.

5. Missing docstrings: While the classes have docstrings, they lack detailed information about their purpose and usage.

6. Inconsistent defaults: Uses different default values than schemas.py (e.g., default="other" vs. default=PromptSource.OTHER).

Recommendations:
1. Consolidate schemas: Either merge these schemas with schemas.py or clearly document their separate purposes.

2. Use Enum types: Replace string types with the appropriate Enum types for source and type fields.

3. Configuration-based values: Use the application configuration for max_length as done in schemas.py.

4. Document relationship: If keeping both files, clearly document when each should be used.

5. Enhance docstrings: Add detailed information about the purpose and usage of each class.

6. Standardize defaults: Ensure consistent default values across all schema definitions.

Fixes Applied:
- Consolidated with schemas.py by importing the core schemas from there
- Added ExtendedPromptRequest that inherits from the base PromptRequest in schemas.py
- Added clear documentation on the relationship between the files
- Removed duplicate validation logic
- Added imports for Enum types from schemas.py
