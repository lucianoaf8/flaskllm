File: api/v1/conversation_routes.py
Purpose: This file should define API routes for conversation management, but it actually contains example code for calendar integration.

Issues Found:
1. Content mismatch: The file is named "conversation_routes.py" but contains example code for calendar integration, not actual API route definitions.

2. File structure: This appears to be a standalone example script, not an API routes module as it should be.

3. Incorrect imports: The file is missing proper Flask-RESTX and API framework imports that would be needed for route definitions.

4. Missing authentication: The examples show hardcoded API tokens which is not a good security practice.

5. Lack of integration: This file doesn't integrate with the rest of the API structure and doesn't follow the pattern established in other route files.

6. Missing error handling: The example code has basic error handling but doesn't use our standardized APIError exceptions.

Recommendations:
1. Relocate the example code to an examples directory
2. Create a proper conversation_routes.py file with actual API route definitions
3. Implement Flask-RESTX routes following the same pattern as in other route files
4. Use the standardized error handling and response format
5. Add proper documentation and Swagger models

Fixes Required:
1. Move the current content to an examples directory
2. Create a new conversation_routes.py file with proper conversation management routes
3. Implement the routes using Flask-RESTX and our standardized patterns
4. Add proper authentication, validation, and error handling
