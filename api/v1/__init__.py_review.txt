File: api/v1/__init__.py
Purpose: Creates a Flask blueprint for v1 API endpoints with Swagger documentation via flask_restx. Serves as the entry point for all v1 API routes.

Issues Found:
1. Circular import risk: The route registration import is inside the function rather than at the top of the file. This can sometimes lead to circular import issues, especially in larger applications.

2. Missing type hints: While the function has a return type annotation, the local variables (v1_bp, api) don't have explicit type annotations.

3. No error handling: The function doesn't include any error handling for the route registration process.

4. Limited documentation: The module docstring could be more comprehensive about the blueprint's purpose and configuration.

5. Fixed API version: The API version ("1.0.0") is hardcoded in the function instead of being configurable or pulled from a constants file.

Recommendations:
1. Move the routes import to the top of the file or restructure to avoid potential circular imports.
2. Add complete type hints for local variables.
3. Add error handling for route registration.
4. Enhance the module documentation to include more details about authentication, available endpoints, and usage.
5. Make the API version configurable or pull it from a constants file.
6. Consider adding health check or version endpoint registration directly in this file.

Fixes Applied:
- Added complete type annotations
- Enhanced module docstring
- Made API version configurable via a parameter
- Added basic error handling for route registration
- Improved function documentation

The file is otherwise well-structured and follows good practices for creating Flask blueprints with RESTx integration.
