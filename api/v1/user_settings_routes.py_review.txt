File: api/v1/user_settings_routes.py
Purpose: Defines API routes for user settings management.

Issues Found:
1. Incorrect imports: The file imports from "api/v1/routes.py" which creates a circular import problem.

2. Module structure: The file doesn't use Flask-RESTX for route definitions like other route files.

3. Missing namespace: There's no namespace definition or register_routes function to integrate with the main API.

4. Inconsistent response format: The responses don't follow the standardized format used in other routes.

5. Error handling: Missing proper exception handling using APIError classes.

6. Missing validation: No validation of input data before processing.

7. Authentication: Uses a simplified API token approach via headers instead of the standardized auth_required decorator.

8. Missing imports: Missing several imports including 'request', 'datetime', etc.

9. Initialization problems: Creates a UserSettingsStorage instance at the module level which could cause issues during app initialization.

10. Documentation: Lacks comprehensive Swagger documentation for the API endpoints.

Recommendations:
1. Restructure file to use Flask-RESTX and Resource classes like other route modules
2. Create proper namespace and register_routes function for API integration
3. Use standardized error handling with APIError exceptions
4. Implement proper response format following project guidelines
5. Add comprehensive validation for all incoming data
6. Use consistent authentication mechanisms
7. Fix imports and initialization issues
8. Add comprehensive documentation for Swagger UI

Fixes Required:
1. Refactor to use Flask-RESTX and Resource classes
2. Add proper namespace and register_routes function
3. Implement standardized error handling
4. Update response format to match project standards
5. Add proper data validation
6. Fix authentication mechanism
7. Add proper imports
8. Fix initialization issues
9. Add comprehensive documentation
