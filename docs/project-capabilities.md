# Project Capability Assessment

You're absolutely right to ask about the core purpose of the project. Let me clarify the current capabilities and what's needed to fulfill the original plan:

## Current Capabilities

✅ **Receiving Office Script Requests**: The `/api/v1/webhook` endpoint is fully designed to receive fetch() calls from Office Scripts containing emails, Teams chats, or tasks.

✅ **Processing Content with LLM**: The API can process this content through an LLM, analyzing and extracting meaning from various sources.

✅ **Structured Response Format**: The API returns processed information in structured JSON format.

⚠️ **External Integrations**: The current implementation **does not yet include** the specific integrations to Google Calendar or beforesunset.ai.

## What's Missing

To fully implement the original plan, we need to add:

1. **Google Calendar Integration**:
   - OAuth2 authentication for Google services
   - Google Calendar API client implementation
   - Event creation/modification handlers

2. **beforesunset.ai Integration**:
   - API client for beforesunset.ai
   - Authentication mechanism
   - Task creation/management handlers

3. **Routing Logic**:
   - Intelligence to determine which service should receive the processed information
   - Content transformation specific to each target service

## Path to Completion

The good news is that the architecture is specifically designed to make these additions straightforward. Here's how we could implement them:

1. Add a new module structure:
   ```
   flaskllm/
   ├── integrations/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── google_calendar.py
   │   └── beforesunset.py
   ```

2. Extend the API schema to include routing information:
   ```json
   {
     "prompt": "Meeting with John on Friday at 2pm",
     "source": "email",
     "destination": "google_calendar"  // or "beforesunset"
   }
   ```

3. Implement the integration handlers in the webhook route.

The modular design means we can add these integrations without changing the existing core functionality.

## Confirmation

**Current status**: The project has the foundation to receive and process information but needs additional work to route to external services.

**Next steps**: If you'd like to proceed with the complete vision, I'd recommend implementing the integration modules as the next priority in the task list.

Would you like me to outline a specific implementation plan for adding either the Google Calendar or beforesunset.ai integration?
