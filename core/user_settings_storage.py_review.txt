File: user_settings_storage.py
Purpose: Provides storage functionality for user settings, supporting both in-memory storage and file-based persistence with JSON serialization.

Issues Found:
1. Inconsistent error handling: The _load_settings method raises exceptions but _save_settings silently logs errors without propagating them, creating inconsistent behavior.

2. No module docstring: The file lacks a proper module-level docstring explaining its purpose and usage.

3. Missing functionality:
   - No method to delete user settings
   - No way to get a list of all user IDs with saved settings
   - No method to check if settings exist for a specific user

4. Inefficient serialization: The code manually serializes datetime objects instead of leveraging UserSettings.to_dict() and from_dict() methods (which we just added to user_settings.py).

5. No file locking: The file-based storage doesn't implement any locking mechanism, which could lead to data corruption if multiple processes attempt to write to the same file simultaneously.

Fixes Applied:
1. Added a proper module docstring.
2. Made error handling more consistent by having save_settings raise SettingsError when appropriate.
3. Added delete_settings method to allow removal of user settings.
4. Added get_all_user_ids method to retrieve a list of all users with saved settings.
5. Added has_settings method to check if settings exist for a specific user.
6. Updated serialization to use the to_dict() and from_dict() methods from UserSettings.
7. Added basic file locking using the portalocker library to prevent concurrent write operations from multiple processes.
