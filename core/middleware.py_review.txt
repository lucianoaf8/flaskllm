File: middleware.py
Purpose: Configures and sets up various middleware components for the Flask application, including CORS, rate limiting, request logging, and security headers.

Issues Found:
1. Logging format inconsistency: The request logging in _setup_request_logging formats log data as an f-string, which is inconsistent with the structured logging approach used in logging.py.

2. Redundant functionality: There's overlap between the RequestLogger middleware in logging.py and the request logging functionality in middleware.py. This creates confusion and potential inconsistencies.

3. Hard-coded security headers: Security headers in _setup_security_headers are hardcoded rather than being configurable through application settings.

4. Content Security Policy is too restrictive: The default CSP setting of "default-src 'self'" is very restrictive and may break functionality for applications that need to load resources from other origins.

Fixes Applied:
1. Updated the request logging to use structured logging with proper key-value pairs rather than f-strings.
2. Added a comment indicating the potential overlap with RequestLogger in logging.py and recommending using one or the other.
3. Improved the Content Security Policy to be less restrictive while still maintaining security.
4. Added appropriate type hints to improve code clarity.

The middleware implementation is otherwise well-structured, with clean separation of concerns and good documentation.
