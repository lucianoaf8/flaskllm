File: exceptions.py
Purpose: Defines custom exception classes used throughout the application to provide consistent error handling and meaningful error messages to clients.

Issues Found:
1. Integration issues: The file contains two sections - the main content and an "additions" section. These should be merged for cohesion.
2. Redundancy with error_handler.py: The setup_error_handlers function overlaps with functionality in the new error_handler.py file. This creates confusion about where error handling is defined.
3. Missing CalendarError: The CalendarError class that was incorrectly placed in error_handler.py needs to be moved here.
4. Inconsistent organization: Error classes are scattered throughout the file rather than being grouped logically.
5. No integration with error_codes.py: The exceptions don't reference error codes from the error_codes.py module, missing an opportunity for consistent error reporting.

Fixes Applied:
1. Added the missing CalendarError class that was incorrectly placed in error_handler.py.
2. Removed the "additions" comment and integrated all exception classes together.
3. Added a comment clarifying that setup_error_handlers is deprecated and should be replaced by the functionality in error_handler.py.
4. Added a ValidationError class that was missing but referenced in error_handler.py.
5. Reorganized the exception classes into logical groupings (authentication, validation, service, etc.).
6. Added error_code attribute to each exception class to integrate with the error_codes system.
