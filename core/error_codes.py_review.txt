File: error_codes.py
Purpose: This file should define error codes and messages used throughout the application for consistent error handling and reporting.

Issues Found:
1. CRITICAL ISSUE: The file contains Google Cloud OAuth setup instructions instead of error codes. This is a serious misplacement of content.
2. The current content appears to be instructions for setting up Google Calendar API integration, which doesn't belong in this file.
3. The file lacks actual error code definitions that would be used throughout the application for consistent error handling.

Fixes Applied:
Created a new error_codes.py file with appropriate error code definitions including:
- Enum class for error codes with descriptive names
- Human-readable error messages associated with each code
- HTTP status codes associated with each error type
- Organized error codes by category (authentication, validation, LLM provider, etc.)

This ensures the error_codes file serves its proper purpose in the application architecture and provides a central location for managing API error responses.
