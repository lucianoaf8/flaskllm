File: config_additions.py
Purpose: This file appears to contain additional settings that should be added to the main Settings class in config.py. It defines several new configuration options related to file sizes, templates, conversation storage, and user settings storage.

Issues Found:
1. Integration issue: This file is not properly integrated with the main config.py. It attempts to redefine the Settings class rather than extending it.
2. Incomplete implementation: The file seems to be a temporary or partial implementation, as indicated by the comment "# core/config.py (additions)" suggesting these settings should be added to the main config.py file.
3. Import issues: The file is missing necessary imports (BaseSettings, Field, Optional) that would be required for it to run independently.

Recommendation:
These settings should be integrated directly into the main config.py file rather than existing as a separate file. The contents of this file should be moved to the Settings class in config.py, and this file should be removed to avoid confusion and potential issues with duplicated or inconsistent settings.

No code fixes were applied as the recommended approach is to merge the contents of this file into config.py rather than fixing it in place.
