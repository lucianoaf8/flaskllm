File: constants.py
Purpose: This file should contain application-wide constants for the Flask LLM API project.

Issues Found:
1. CRITICAL ISSUE: The file contains PythonAnywhere WSGI configuration code instead of constants. This is a serious misplacement of code.
2. The current content appears to be from a different file (pythonanywhere_wsgi.py) that should be in the deployment configuration, not in the core module.
3. The file lacks actual constants that would be used throughout the application.

Fixes Applied:
Created a new constants.py file with appropriate application constants including:
- Default values for common settings
- HTTP response codes and standard messages
- Rate limiting constants
- Common header names
- Cache-related constants

This ensures the constants file serves its proper purpose in the application architecture.
