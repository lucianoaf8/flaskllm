File: cache.py
Purpose: Implements a caching system for LLM responses with multiple backend options (in-memory, file-based, Redis, MySQL). This reduces API costs and improves response times by storing and retrieving previously generated responses.

Issues Found:
1. Missing imports in the MySQLCache class:
   - The `create_engine` and `text` imports from SQLAlchemy are missing
   - Without these imports, the MySQL cache implementation will fail

2. Inconsistent class implementation:
   - Other cache classes inherit from `_BaseCache` but `MySQLCache` doesn't
   - Other cache classes have underscore prefix (_InMemoryCache, _FileCache, _RedisCache) but MySQLCache doesn't follow this pattern
   - Return type in MySQLCache.get() is `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]` as in other implementations

3. Invalid code in the base class:
   - The `_BaseCache.get()` method has `...` as implementation which isn't valid Python - it should use pass, @abstractmethod, or raise NotImplementedError

Fixes Applied:
1. Added missing SQLAlchemy imports
2. Updated MySQLCache to inherit from _BaseCache and follow the consistent naming convention
3. Fixed the base class method implementations with proper placeholder pattern
4. Updated the return type annotation in MySQLCache.get() to match other implementations
