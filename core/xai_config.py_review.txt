File: xai_config.py
Purpose: This file should provide configuration for the XAI (Explainable AI) integration with the LLM API, but currently contains misplaced calendar event schemas.

Issues Found:
1. CRITICAL ISSUE: The file contains calendar event schemas that are completely unrelated to XAI configuration. These schemas should be in the API schemas directory, not in the core module.

2. Missing functionality: The file does not contain any actual XAI configuration as suggested by its name. It's missing the expected content for configuring explainable AI features.

3. File purpose mismatch: The comment at the top indicates this content belongs in "api/v1/schemas.py" but is incorrectly placed in the core directory.

4. Inconsistent schema validation: The schemas use Marshmallow instead of Pydantic, which is inconsistent with the project guidelines that recommend using Pydantic for validation.

Recommendation:
1. Move the calendar event schemas to the appropriate location in the API schemas directory (api/v1/schemas.py).
2. Create a proper XAI configuration file that includes:
   - Configuration options for explainable AI features
   - Integration settings for XAI providers
   - Default parameters for XAI requests
   - Methods for generating explanations for model outputs

The file should be completely replaced with proper XAI configuration content.
