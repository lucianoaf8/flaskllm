File: __init__.py
Purpose: This file serves as a Python package marker for the core module. It's currently empty, which indicates that the core module doesn't expose any specific symbols or functionality to be imported directly.

Issues Found: None.

While empty __init__.py files are valid, considering the project guidelines outlined in flask-llm-guidelines.md which encourage using __init__.py files to "expose only necessary imports", this file could potentially be enhanced to expose key components from the core module for easier importing by other parts of the application.

Recommendation: Consider updating the file to expose key components, allowing for cleaner imports like:
```python
from flaskllm.core import config, exceptions, error_handler
```
Instead of:
```python
from flaskllm.core.config import Config
from flaskllm.core.exceptions import LLMAPIError
from flaskllm.core.error_handler import handle_error
```

No changes made since this is a design decision rather than a bug or inconsistency.
