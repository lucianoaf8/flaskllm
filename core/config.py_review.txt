File: config.py
Purpose: Provides configuration management for the application using Pydantic for settings validation and environment variable loading. Defines environment types, LLM providers, and a comprehensive Settings class with validations.

Issues Found:
1. Nested CacheBackendType enum: The CacheBackendType enum is defined inside the Settings class, but it's imported directly in cache.py as if it were defined at the module level. This mismatch in import paths could cause errors.

2. Inconsistent spacing: In the CacheBackendType definition, there's inconsistent spacing between the enum values and their descriptions (e.g., "MEMORY = "memory"      # inâ€‘process dict" has many spaces while others have different spacing).

3. Missing validation for redis_url and mysql_url: While there are validators for API keys, there's no validation that redis_url is provided when REDIS is selected as the cache backend or that mysql_url is provided when MYSQL is selected.

Fixes Applied:
1. Moved CacheBackendType outside the Settings class to make it accessible at the module level as expected by cache.py.
2. Standardized the spacing in the enum definitions for consistency.
3. Added validators for redis_url and mysql_url when their respective cache backends are selected.
