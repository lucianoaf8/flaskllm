File: error_handler.py
Purpose: This file should provide error handling functionality for the application, including centralized error handling and response formatting.

Issues Found:
1. CRITICAL ISSUE: The file contains a fragment of code that appears to belong in exceptions.py, not in the error handler. This is a serious misplacement of code.
2. The content is just a single class definition (CalendarError) that should be in the exceptions module.
3. The file lacks actual error handling functionality that would connect exceptions with the error codes and generate consistent API responses.

Fixes Applied:
Created a proper error_handler.py file with:
- A centralized error handling function that can be used with Flask's error handlers
- Functions to format error responses consistently
- Integration with the error_codes.py module to ensure consistent error messaging
- Logging of errors with appropriate detail levels
- Support for both development and production error formatting (with configurable detail levels)

This ensures the error_handler.py file serves its proper purpose in the application architecture.
